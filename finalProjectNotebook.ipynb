    "# DEPA Final Project (Fall 2019)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benedict Au | Nov 2, 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.1. Executive summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Alcohol is one of the most popular purchases in the US, but does consumers’ love of beer vary with their economic condition? In this project, we seek to derive insights on alcohol consumption patterns with respect to changes in US economic metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Questions that this project can potentially answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do preferences for beer types change during recession? Do consumers favor particular beers, price points, or alcohol content?\n",
    "- How does unemployment affect beer purchasing? Does it significantly impact the total amount purchased, or just shifts the product mix?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2. Business use case\n",
    "\n",
    "This project can provide insight into consumer purchasing habits, which is highly desirable to a variety of businesses. Breweries can use this data to plan their production, such that they focus their production on the beer with the highest expected demand. Retailers and restaurants can use this data to plan their inventory, stocking particular products ahead of expected increases in demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.3. Data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "- The IRI Academic Marketing Data Set (Bronnenberg, et al, 2012) - 130 GB unzipped - NDA required, access through The University of Chicago Office of Research and National Laboratories Research Computing Center \n",
    "- St. Louis Fed Federal Research Economic Data (FRED) - through FRED API\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.4 Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 4 requires an empty schema `beer` in MySQL 8. The code is provided in `section 4.0`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following packages are also required and can be installed using `pip` or `conda`:  \n",
    "`os`, `glob`, `NumPy`, `pandas-0.25`, `functools`, `sqlalchemy`, `tqdm`, and `fredapi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**: pandas version `0.24.+` is required as pandas has gained the ability to hold integer dtypes with missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.5. Sections in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections in this notebook progress as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "Section 1 explains the procedure to access the IRI dataset on UChicago Research Computing Center and documents the steps taken to extract the necessary files and directories pertinent to this project, given the limitations of the memory size of personal laptop computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Section 2 provides an overview of the IRI dataset and its various dimensions, their limitations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Section 3 describes the fact-dimension schema in MySQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Section 4 contains the code for data intake and manipulation. It also pushes pandas dataframes into an empty MySQL `beer` schema. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. IRI Data extraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connect to RCC /project2: <https://rcc.uchicago.edu/docs/data-transfer/index.html> smb://midwaysmb.rcc.uchicago.edu/project2 Username: ADLOCAL\\CNetID Password: CNet password Hostname: midwaysmb.rcc.uchicago.edu\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Navigate to `/projects/databases/IRIData/`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Unzip `zYearXX` files and extract beer directory\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Relocate contents of `BEER` directory into `YearXX` directory\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Rename `zparsed stub files.zip` as `parsed stub files.zip`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Collect all BEER product attribute files `parsed stub files` into the directory \"beer_attributes\".\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Renamed `prod_beer.xlsx` and `prod_beer_sz.xlsx` from the `parsed stub files` directory as `prod01_beer.xlsx` and `prod01_beer_sz.xlsx`.\n",
    "  - Renamed prod_beer.xlsx from the `parsed stub files 2007` directory as `prod07_beer.xlsx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Overview of the `IRI dataset`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset size: 8 GB unzipped\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset range: January 1, 2001 (week 1114) to December 30, 2012 (1739).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data sets are separated by year. In each year, there are the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ADB Measure Definitions.doc` defines store measures\n",
    "- `Delivery_Stores` defines stores included in the year's files\n",
    "- `demos.csv` identifies the demographics of the panelists\n",
    "- `IRI week translation.xls` defines the conversion of week numbers to dates.\n",
    "- `panel_measure_definition.doc` defines panel measures. This file is slightly different for years 2008-2011.\n",
    "- `Category_outlet_startweek_endweek` with no file extension contains store-week level data\n",
    "- `Category_PANEL_outlet_startweek_endweek.dat` DAT file contains panel data at transaction level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TO DO** For years 1, 2, 6, 7, and 12, the `DEMOS.csv` files are located in the directory `demo trips external`. Move these into each YearXX directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for 2001-2007, the outlet categories are:\n",
    "- {DR: drug, GR: groceries, MA: mass}. \n",
    "\n",
    "For 2008-2011, the outlet categories are:\n",
    "- {DK: drug, GK: groceries, MK: mass}.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Week numbers - `IRI WEEK Translation` file description:\n",
    "\n",
    "- End date = (weekNumber - 400) * 7 + 31900\n",
    "- Start date = (weekNumber - 400) * 7 + 31900 - 6\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggestion:** week conversions can be calculated instead of creating a data table to house this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Sales data - `Category_outlet_startweek_endweek` file description:\n",
    "\n",
    "The store data files are the largest files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the store data and panel data files are keyed to the dimensional information (store, week, UPC fields, [panelist]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Records within a file represent a transaction by store-week-upc (universal product code).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naming convention:** The naming convention for these is category name then outlet then start week and then end week, all separated by underscores, with no extension, so salted snacks drug data for the earliest year would be `saltsnck_drug_1114_1165`.\n",

    "The dollars column reflects the retail price paid, on average, after retail features, displays and retail coupons. It does not include manufacturer coupons or any discount that might be applied by the retailer that is not applicable to the item. For example, if a retailer gave USD5 off if you purchased more than USD200, that discount is not applied. Sales taxes are not included.\n",
    "\n",
    "The F column denotes whether there was a marketing feature within the store, such a small or large-sized ad. The D column denotes whether there was a marketing display of the product within the store.\n",

    "### 2.3. `Delivery_Stores` file description:\n",
    "\n",
    "The file contains each store \"masked\" using the sequence key as it's identifier across the various tables. This file also contains outlet, estimated acv, the market name so data can be aggregated by market, an open and close week, and finally a \"chain\" number representing a particular retailer. All the stores belonging to Chain8 are part of the same retailer that year.\n",
    "\n",
